How to build
============

The solution file(Unicue.sln) is for Visual Studio Community 2019.  
Make sure you have copied [WTL 10](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/files/WTL%2010/)'s header files to including folder of VC++, or 
you should add path of WTL's header files into project.

The including path for WTL in VS2019 sounds like:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.28.29910\atlmfc\include

Good luck!
