How to build
============

The solution file(Unicue.sln) is for Visual Studio Community 2015.  
Make sure you have copied [WTL 9.1](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/files/WTL%209.1/)'s header files to including folder of VC++, or 
you should add path of WTL's header files into project.

The including path for WTL in VS2015 sounds like:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\atlmfc\include

Good luck!
